# Machine learning

With this project I have decided to use Panda as my python library.

The guide I used for my project is linked [here](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ml_multiple_regression.asp)

## What model is this based on?

Linear regression is predicting the value of a dependent variable based on the independent variable.

Pandas uses multiple regression as its machine learning model, multiple regression is similar to linear regression however there is more than one independent value.
